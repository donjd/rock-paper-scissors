# rock-paper-scissors

Simple rock paper scissors game with 5 rounds.

UI goals:

1. Make it feel and function like an old school terminal
2. Ideas for commands:
   - rps score = returns the current score
   - rps rock/paper/scissors = chooses weapon || has thre flashing buttons the user can choose
   - rps new = starts a new game with reset score
   - rps --help = returns a list of the available commands
   - rps clear = clears the screen if too messy
3. Make it print a new line every time so it feels like the terminal
4. Flashing box cursor
5. Would be really cool if I could figure out how to print out each character one at a time in quick succession to make it feel a bit sci-fi
